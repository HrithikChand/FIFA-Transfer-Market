## Introduction

Arsenal Football Club is a professional football club based in Islington, London, England. Arsenal plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. The club has won 13 league titles , a record 14 FA Cups, two League Cups, 16 FA Community Shields, the League Centenary Trophy, one European Cup Winners' Cup, and one Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

Lately the club has been struggling a lot and not been able to qualify for the European Club Competition. So the board has requested the recruitment team to recruit players and also fix the squad and give a proper report to work upon.

So we are using the FIFA data for this problem.

We will analyze the squad and check the youth prospects in our squad and contract situation of the team. 
Once we get squad info we will try to check the position which we need to fill so that we can bring the club back on track.

Hope you like this and appreciate the idea !!! :smiley:
